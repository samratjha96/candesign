Create html and css only websites to demonstrate an example of each of the following design patterns:

```
1. Modern "SaaS" Styles
Bento Grid: Inspired by Japanese lunch boxes, this style organizes information into modular, rounded rectangular "cells" of varying sizes. It’s the current "it" style for dashboards and landing pages (made famous by Apple and Linear).

Minimalism (High-End): Focuses on massive white space, high-contrast typography, and a "less is more" philosophy. It relies on perfect alignment rather than decorative elements.

Skeuomorphism (The "New" Version): Making digital elements look like real-world materials. While "Flat Design" killed this for a decade, it is returning in subtle ways through textures that look like paper, metal, or plastic.

2. "Morphism" (Depth & Texture)
Glassmorphism: Uses transparency, background blur (frosted glass effect), and thin borders to create a sense of vertical layers. Very common in macOS and modern "futuristic" apps.

Neumorphism (Soft UI): Uses clever highlights and shadows to make buttons and cards look like they are "pushed out" of the background material. It creates a soft, extruded plastic look.

Claymorphism: A 3D aesthetic characterized by soft, rounded, "inflated" shapes that look like clay. It’s often paired with vibrant colors and 3D illustrations.

3. Bold & Retro Styles
Neobrutalism: A reaction against "boring" corporate design. It uses high-contrast black outlines, harsh shadows (often not blurred), clashing "ugly-cool" colors, and bold, chunky typography. Think of the site Gumroad.

Retro-Futurism / Y2K: Uses 90s/early 2000s aesthetics—pixels, glitch effects, neon colors, and "techy" fonts—but with modern high-resolution execution.

Editorial / Swiss Style: Deeply rooted in print design. It uses a strict grid, large "hero" typography, and treats a website like a luxury magazine spread.

4. Color & Light Aesthetics
Aurora / Mesh Gradients: Using soft, multi-colored, fluid gradients that look like the Northern Lights. It adds a "dreamy" or high-end tech feel to backgrounds.

Dark Mode (Sleek/OLED): More than just a color flip; it's a specific aesthetic using "True Black" or deep charcoals with vibrant neon accents to make content pop.

The concept of the websites can be whatever. Apply maximum creativity make it match the themes maybe but demonstrate what these design aesthetics look like in each individual website
