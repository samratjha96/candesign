That was great. Continue doing the same for a few more design ideas:

```
1. The "Nature & Cozy" Vibes
Boho (Bohemian): Earthy tones (terracotta, sage, mustard), macramé textures, organic shapes, and a relaxed "lived-in" feel.

Web App Use: Great for wellness apps, artisan marketplaces, or personal blogs.

Cottagecore: Romanticizing rural life. Soft pastels, floral patterns, vintage illustrations, and serif fonts that look like they belong in an old book.

Japandi: A mix of Japanese minimalism and Scandinavian functionality. Lots of light wood textures, neutral "greige" (gray-beige) palettes, and plenty of empty space.

Web App Use: Perfect for "Focus" apps or minimalist productivity tools.

2. The "Intellectual & Moody" Vibes
Dark Academia: Inspired by old libraries, Ivy League schools, and gothic architecture. Think deep greens, burgundies, dark wood, and typewriter fonts.

Web App Use: Ideal for writing apps, note-taking software, or educational platforms.

Light Academia: The sunnier cousin of Dark Academia. Beige, cream, and coffee tones with a focus on classical art and "old-school" scholarly vibes.

Whimsigothic: A mix of whimsical/celestial (moons, stars, velvet) and gothic (dark colors, heavy lace). It’s "witchy" but professional.

3. The "Tech & Nostalgia" Vibes
Y2K / Frutiger Aero: That "glossy" tech look from 2000–2010. Think bright blues, bubbles, water droplets, and high-gloss buttons. It’s making a massive comeback as "nostalgic tech."

Vaporwave: Neon pinks and purples, 80s statues, glitch art, and a "lo-fi" digital sunset vibe.

Cyberpunk: High-contrast dark backgrounds with neon "glow" accents (cyan, magenta). Very high-tech, futuristic, and "hacker" feeling.

4. The "Clean & Aesthetic" Trends
Clean Girl / Minimalistcore: Ultra-polished, beige/white palettes, gold accents, and "glowy" aesthetics. It feels expensive, healthy, and organized.

Old Money / Quiet Luxury: Focuses on "preppy" colors (navy blue, cream, forest green), classic typography (like Times New Roman but spaced out), and no "flashy" logos.

Indie / Kidcore: Explosions of primary colors, "sticker" style icons, and a purposefully unpolished, high-energy vibe.
